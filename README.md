# HR tool

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with additional simple redux setup and routes file.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### Installation -

**You’ll need to have Node 8.9.0 (https://nodejs.org/) or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone git@git.pawoon.com:internal-tools/eb-react-cicd.git
$ cd eb-react-cicd
$ npm install // yarn install
$ npm start
```
